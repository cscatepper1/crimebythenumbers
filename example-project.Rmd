# A soup to nuts project example

We'll finish the Introduction part of the book by going over a brief example of a kind of data project that you'd do in the real world. For this chapter we'll look at FBI homicide data that you can download [here](https://github.com/jacobkap/r4crimz/tree/master/data). The file is called "shr_1976_2020.rds".


Below is a large chunk of R code along with some comments about what the code does. The purpose of this example is to show that with relative little code (excluding blank lines and comments, there are only 35 lines of R code here) you can go from opening a dataset to making a graph that answers you research question. I don't expect you to understand any of this code as it is fairly complex and involves many different concepts in programming. So if the code is scary - and for many early programmers, including myself, seeing a bunch of code that you don't understand is scary and overwhelming - feel free to ignore the code itself. We'll cover each of these skills in turn throughout the book so by the end of the book you should be able to come back and understand the code (and modify it to meet your own needs). The important thing is that you can see exactly why R can do (and this is only a tiny example of R's flexibility) and think about the process to get there (which we'll talk about below). 

At the time of this writing, the FBI had just released 2020 crime data which showed about a 30% increase in murders relative to 2019. This had led to an explosion of (in my opinion highly premature) explanations of why exactly murder went up so much in 2020. A common explanation is that it is largely driven by gun violence among gang members who are killing each other in a cyclical pattern of murders followed by retaliatory murders. For our coding example, we'll examine that claim by seeing if gang violence did indeed increase, and whether they increased more than other types of murders. 

The end result is the graph below. It is, in my opinion, a fairly strong answer to our question. It shows the percent change in murders by the victim-offender relationship from 2019 to 2020. This is using FBI murder data which technically does have a variable that says if the murder is gang related, but it's a flawed variable so I prefer to use stranger and acquaintance murders as a proxy. And we now have an easy to read graph that shows that while indeed stranger and acquaintance murders did go up a lot, nearly all relationship groups experienced far more murders in 2020 than in 2019. This suggests that there was a broad increase in murder in 2020, and was not driven merely by an increase in one or a few groups.

This is something that we can examine directly using data released by the FBI. 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(crimeutils)
library(tidyr)

# Load in the data
shr <- readRDS("data/shr_1976_2020.rds") 

# See which agencies reported in 2019 and 2020
# An "ori" is a unique identified for agencies in FBI data
agencies_2019 <- shr$ori[shr$year == 2019]
agencies_2020 <- shr$ori[shr$year == 2020]
# Get which agencies reported in both years so we have an apples-to-apples comparison
agencies_in_both <- agencies_2019[agencies_2019 %in% agencies_2020]
# Just unique agencies
agencies_in_both <- unique(agencies_in_both)

# Keep just data from 2019 and 2020 and where the agencies is one of the
# agencies chosen above
shr_2019_and_2020 <-
  shr %>%
  filter(year %in% 2019:2020,
         ori %in% agencies_in_both,
         homicide_type %in% "murder and nonnegligent manslaughter")

# Get the number of murders by victim-offender relationship in 2019 and 2020
# Then find the percent change in murders by this group from 2019 to 2020
# Sort data by largest to smallest percent change
shr_difference <- 
  shr_2019_and_2020 %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  count(victim_1_relation_to_offender_1) %>%
  spread(year, n) %>%
  mutate(difference = `2020` - `2019`,
         percent_change = difference / `2019` * 100,
         victim_1_relation_to_offender_1 = capitalize_words(victim_1_relation_to_offender_1)) %>%
  filter(`2019` >= 50) %>%
  arrange(percent_change)

# Print out some summary statistics (e.g. mean, median, max) about the percent change
print(summary(shr_difference$percent_change))

# This is only for the graph. By default graphs order alphabetically but this makes
# sure it orders it based on the ordering we made above (largest to smallest percent
# change)
shr_difference$victim_1_relation_to_offender_1 <- 
  factor(shr_difference$victim_1_relation_to_offender_1,
         levels = shr_difference$victim_1_relation_to_offender_1)

# Makes a barplot showing the percent change from 2019 to 2020 in number of murders
# by victim group. Labels the x-axis and the y-axis, shifts the graph
# so that relationship labels are on the y-axis for easy reading. And finally
# uses the "crim" theme that changes the colors in the graph to make it a little
# easier to see.
ggplot(shr_difference, aes(x = victim_1_relation_to_offender_1, 
                                        y = percent_change)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  ylab("Percent Change, 2020 Vs. 2019") +
  xlab("Who Victim Is Relative to Murderer") + 
  coord_flip() +
  theme_crim() 
```

One of the main benefits of programming is that once you write code to do one thing, it's usually very easy to adapt it to do a similar thing. Below I've copied some of the code we used above and changed only one thing - instead of looking at the column "victim_1_relation_to_offender_1" we're now looking at the column "offender_1_weapon". That's all I did, everything else is identical. Now after about 10 seconds of copying and changing the column name, we have a graph that shows weapon usage changes from 2019 to 2020 instead of victim-offender relationship. 

```{r}
shr_difference <- 
  shr_2019_and_2020 %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  count(offender_1_weapon) %>%
  spread(year, n) %>%
  mutate(difference = `2020` - `2019`,
         percent_change = difference / `2019` * 100,
         offender_1_weapon = capitalize_words(offender_1_weapon)) %>%
  filter(`2019` >= 50) %>%
  arrange(percent_change)

shr_difference$offender_1_weapon <- 
  factor(shr_difference$offender_1_weapon,
         levels = shr_difference$offender_1_weapon)
ggplot(shr_difference, aes(x = offender_1_weapon, 
                                        y = percent_change)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  ylab("Percent Change, 2020 Vs. 2019") +
  xlab("Offender Weapon") + 
  coord_flip() +
  theme_crim() 
```

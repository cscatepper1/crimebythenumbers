# R 4 Criminology

These notes form the basis of an introductory course in R with a focus on skills relevant for criminology students. Students code in R to answer questions like "what do victims of murder look like?" and "are Pennsylvanians drinking more beer than they used to?" and "where do police shootings occur in Philadelphia?". On the way to answering these questions students learn about regular expressions, webscraping, mapping, handling geographic data, official data sources (UCR, NIBRS, ACS), and basic data coding skills.

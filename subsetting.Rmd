# Subsetting: Making big things small {#subsetting-intro}

For this chapter you'll need the following file, which is available for download [here](https://github.com/jacobkap/crimebythenumbers/tree/master/data): offenses_known_yearly_1960_2020.rds.

Subsetting data is a way to take a large data set and reduce it to a smaller one that is better suited for answering a specific question. This is useful when you have a lot of data in the data set that isn't relevant to your research - for example, if you are studying crime in Colorado and have every state in your data, you'd subset it to keep only the Colorado data. Reducing it to a smaller data set makes it easier to manage, both in understanding your data and avoiding have a huge file that could slow down R. 

## Select specific values

```{r}
animals <- c("cat", "dog", "gorilla", "buffalo", "lion", "snake")
```

```{r}
animals
```

Here we have made a vector object called *animals* with a number of different animals in it. In R, we will use square brackets `[]` to select specific values in that object, something called "indexing." Put a number (or numbers) in the square bracket, and it will return the value at that "index." The index is just the place number where each value is. "cat" is the first value in *animals* so it is at the first index, "dog" is the second value so it is the second index or index 2. "snake" is our last value and is the 6th value in *animals* so it is index 6.^[Some languages use "zero indexing," which means the first index is index 0, the second is index 1. So in our example "cat" would be index 0. R does not do that, and the first value is index 1, the second is index 2, and so on.]

The syntax (how the code is written) goes

`object[index]`

First, we have the object and then we put the square bracket `[]`. We need both the object and the `[]` for subsetting to work. Let's say we wanted to choose just the "snake" from our *animals* object. In normal language we say "I want the 6th value from *animals*." We say where we're looking and which value we want. 

```{r}
animals[6]
```

Now let's get the third value.

```{r}
animals[3]
```

If we want multiple values, we can enter multiple numbers. If you have multiple values, you need to make a vector using `c()` and put the numbers inside the parentheses separated by a comma. If we wanted values 1-3, we could use `c(1, 2, 3)`, with each number separated by a comma.

```{r}
animals[c(1, 2, 3)]
```

When making a vector of sequential integers, instead of writing them all out manually we can use `first_number:last_number` like so

```{r}
1:3
```

To use it in subsetting we can treat `1:3` as if we wrote `c(1, 2, 3)`.

```{r}
animals[1:3]
```

The order we enter the numbers determines the order of the values it returns. Let's get the third index, the fourth index, and the first index, in that order.

```{r}
animals[c(3, 4, 1)]
```

Putting a negative number inside the `[]` will return all values **except** for that index, essentially deleting it. Let's remove "cat" from *animals*. Since it is the 1st item in *animals*, we can remove it like this 

```{r}
animals[-1]
```

Now let's remove multiple values, the first 3.

```{r}
animals[-c(1, 2, 3)]
```

When using the `first_number:last_number` notation, we need to put it in parentheses if we want to turn it negative. If we don't, it will just think that the first value is a negative number, and give every integer from that first value to the last value.

```{r}
-1:3
```

Putting it in parentheses will create the integers first and then turn them all negative.

```{r}
animals[-(1:3)]
```


Earlier I said we can remove values with using a negative number and that index will be removed from the object. For example, `animals[-1]` prints every value in *animals* except for the first value.

```{r}
animals[-1]
```

However, it doesn't actually remove anything from *animals*. Let's print *animals* and see which values it returns.

```{r}
animals
```

Now the first value, "cats," is back. Why? To make changes in R you need to tell R very explicitly that you are making the change. If you don't save the result of your code (by assigning an object to it), R will run that code and simply print the results in the Console panel without making any changes. 

This is an important point that a lot of students struggle with. R doesn't know when you want to save (in this context I am referring to creating or updating an object that is entirely in R, not saving a file to your computer) a value or update an object. If *x* is an object with a value of 2, and you write `x + 2`, it would print out 4 because 2 + 2 = 4. But that won't change the value of *x*. *x* will remain as 2 until you explicitly tell R to change its value. If you want to update *x* you need to run `x <- somevalue` or `x = somevalue`, where "somevalue" is whatever you want to change *x* to. 

So to return to our *animals* example, if we wanted to delete the first value and keep it removed, we'd need to write `animals <- animals[-1]`. Which is essentially making a new object, also called *animals* (to avoid having many, slightly different objects that are hard to keep track of we'll reuse the name) with the same values as the original *animals* except this time excluding the first value, "cats."

## Logical values and operations

We also frequently want to conditionally select certain values. Earlier we selected values by indexing specific numbers, but that requires us to know exactly which values we want. We can conditionally select values by having some conditional statement (e.g. "this value is lower than the number 100") and keeping only values where that condition is true. 

First, we will discuss conditionals abstractly and then we will use a real example using data from the FBI to make a data set tailored to answer a specific question.

We can use these TRUE and FALSE (in R true and false must be spelled all in capital letters and without quotes. For the book section on logical values, please see Section \@ref(section-data-types)) values to index, and it will return every element which we say is TRUE. 

```{r}
animals[c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE)]
```

This is the basis of conditional subsetting. If we have a large data set and only want a small chunk based on some condition (e.g. data for certain states, data for a certain time period, data with at least a certain population) we need to make a conditional statement that returns TRUE if it matches what we want and FALSE if it doesn't. There are a number of different ways to make conditional statements. First let's go through some special characters involved and then show examples of each one.

For each case you are asking: does the thing on the left of the conditional statement return TRUE or FALSE compared to the thing on the right. 

  + `==  ` Equals (compared to a single value)
  + `%in%` Equals (one value match out of multiple comparisons)
  + `!=  ` Does not equal
  + `<   ` Less than
  + `>   ` Greater than
  + `<=  ` Less than or equal to
  + `>=  ` Greater than or equal to
  
Since many conditionals involve numbers (especially in criminology), let's make a new object called *numbers* with the numbers 1-10.

```{r}
numbers <- 1:10
```

### Matching a single value

The conditional `==` asks if the thing on the left equals the thing on the right. Note that it uses two equal signs. If we used only one equal sign it would assign the thing on the left the value of the thing on the right (as if we did `<-`). 

```{r}
2 == 2
```

This gives `TRUE` as we know that 2 does equal 2. If we change either value, it would give us `FALSE`.

```{r}
2 == 3
```

And it works when we have multiple numbers on the left side, such as our object called *numbers*. This returns TRUE only for the value in *numbers* that is 2. For all other values it returns FALSE.

```{r}
numbers == 2
```

This also works with characters such as the animals in the object we made earlier. "gorilla" is the third animal in our object, so if we check `animals == "gorilla"` we expect the third value to be `TRUE` and all others to be `FALSE`. Make sure that the match is spelled correctly (including capitalization) and is in quotes. 

```{r}
animals == "gorilla"
```

The `==` only works when there is one thing on the right-hand side. In criminology we often want to know if there is a match for multiple things - is the crime one of the following crimes..., did the crime happen in one of these months..., is the victim a member of these demographic groups...? So we need a way to check if a value is one of many values. 

### Matching multiple values

The R operator `%in%` asks each value on the left whether or not it is a member of the set on the right. It asks, is the single value on the left-hand side (even when there are multiple values such as our *animals* object, it goes through them one at a time) a match with any of the values on the right-hand side? It only has to match with one of the right-hand side values to be a match.

```{r}
2 %in% c(1, 2, 3) 
```

For our *animals* object, if we check if they are in the vector `c("cat", "dog", "gorilla")`, now all three of those animals will return `TRUE`.

```{r}
animals %in% c("cat", "dog", "gorilla")
```


### Does not match

Sometimes it is easier to ask what is not a match. For example, if you wanted to get every month except January, instead of writing the other 11 months, you just ask for any month that does not equal "January". 

We can use `!=`, which means "not equal". When we wanted an exact match, we used `==`, if we want a not match, we can use `!=` (this time it is only a single equals sign). 

```{r}
2 != 3
```

```{r}
"cat" != "gorilla"
```

Note that for matching multiple values with `%in%`, we cannot write `!%in%` but have to put the `!` before the values on the left.

```{r}
!animals %in% c("cat", "dog", "gorilla")
```

### Greater than or less than

We can use R to compare values using greater than or less than symbols. We can also express "greater than or equal to" or "less than or equal to."

```{r}
6 > 5
```

```{r}
6 < 5
```

```{r}
6 >= 5
```

```{r}
5 <= 5
```

When used on our object *numbers* it will return 10 values (since *numbers* is 10 elements long) with a `TRUE` if the condition is true for the element and `FALSE` otherwise. Let's run `numbers > 3`. We expect the first 3 values to be `FALSE` as 1, 2, and 3 are not larger than 3.

```{r}
numbers > 3
```

### Combining conditional statements - or, and

In many cases when you are subsetting you will want to subset based on more than one condition. These "conditional statements" can be tricky for new R users since you need to remember both what conditions you need *and* the R code to write it. For a simple introduction to combining conditional statements, we'll first start with the dog food instructions for my new puppy Peanut.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('images/peanut.png')
```

Here, the instructions indicate how much food to feed your dog each day. Then instructions are broken down into dog age **and** expected size (in pounds or kilograms), and the intersection of these tells you how much food to feed your dog. Even once you figure out how much to feed the dog, there's another conditional statement to figure out whether you feed them twice a day or three times a day. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('images/dog_food.PNG')
```

This food chart is basically a conditional statement matrix where you match the conditions on the left side with those on the top to figure out how much to feed your dog.^[If you encounter some conditional statements that confuse you - which will be more common as you combine many statements together - I encourage you to make a matrix like this yourself. Even if it isn't that complicated, I think it's easier to see it written down than to try to keep all of the possible conditions in your head.] 

So if we wanted to figure out how much to feed a dog that is three months old and will be 4.4 pounds, we'd use the first row on the left (which says 4.4 pounds/2.2 kilograms) and the second column (which says three months old). When the dog gets to be four-months-old we'd keep the same row but now move one column to the right. In normal English you'd say that the dog is four months old and their expected size is 4.4 pounds (2 kg). The language when talking about (and writing code for) a conditional statement in programming is a bit more formal where every condition is spoken as a yes or no question. Here we ask is the dog four months old **and** is the expected weight 4.4 pounds? If both are true, then we give the dog the amount of food shown for those conditions. If only one is true, then the whole thing is wrong - we wouldn't want to underfeed or overfeed our dog. In this example, a four month old dog can eat between 5/8th of a cup of food and 2 cups depending on their expected size. So having only one condition be true isn't enough. 

Can you see any issue with this conditional statement matrix? It doesn't cover the all possible choices for age and weight combinations. In fact, it is really quite narrow in what it does cover. For example, it covers two- and three-months, but not any age in between. We can assume that a dog that is 2.5 months old would eat the average of two and three month meal amounts, but wouldn't know for sure. When making your own statements please consider what conditions you are checking for - and, importantly, what you're leaving out.

For a real data example, let's say you have crime data from every state between 1960 and 2020. Your research question is "did Colorado's marijuana legalization affect crime in the state?" In that case you want only data from Colorado. Since legalization began in January 2014, you wouldn't need every year, only years some period of time before and after legalization to be able to measure its effect. So you would need to subset based on the state and the year. 

To make conditional statements with multiple conditions we use `|` for "or" and `&` for "and". 

`Condition 1 | Condition 2 `

```{r}
2 == 3 | 2 > 1
```

As it sounds, when using `|` as long as at least one condition is true (we can include as many conditions as we like)  it will return `TRUE`. 

`Condition 1 & Condition 2`

```{r}
2 == 3 & 2 > 1
```

For `&`, all of the conditions must be true. If even one condition is not true it will return `FALSE`.

## Subsetting a data.frame 

Earlier we were using a simple vector. In this book - and in your own work - you will usually work on an entire data set. These generally come in the form called a "data.frame," which you can imagine as being like an Excel file with multiple rows and columns. Section \@ref(dataframes) covers data.frames in more detail.

Let's load in data from the Uniform Crime Report (UCR), an FBI data set that we'll work on in a later lesson. This data has crime data every year from 1960-2020 and for nearly every agency in the country.

```{r}
ucr <- readRDS("data/offenses_known_yearly_1960_2020.rds")
```

Let's peek at the first 6 rows and 6 columns using the square bracket notation `[]` for data.frames, which we'll explain more below.

```{r}
ucr[1:6, 1:6]
```

The first 6 rows appear to be agency identification info for Anchorage, Alaska, from 2015-2020. For good measure let's check how many rows and columns are in this data. This will give us some guidance on subsetting, which we'll see below. `nrow()` gives us the number of rows and `ncol()` gives us the number of columns.

```{r}
nrow(ucr)
```

```{r}
ncol(ucr)
```

This is a large file with 223 columns and over a million rows. Normally we wouldn't want to print out the names of all 223 columns, but let's do so here as we want to know the variables available to subset. We can use `names()` to see the name of every column in a data.frame. Inside the parentheses we put the data.frame name (without quotes).

```{r}
names(ucr)
```

Now let's discuss how to subset this data into a smaller data set to answer a specific question. Let's subset the data to answer our above question of "did Colorado's marijuana legalization affect crime in the state?" Like mentioned above, we need data just from Colorado and just for years around the legalization year - we can do 2011-2017 for simplicity. 

We also don't need all 223 columns in the current data. Let's say we're only interested in whether murder changes. We'd need the column called *actual_murder*, the *state* column (as a check to make sure we subset only Colorado), the *year* column, the *population* column, the *ori* column, and the *agency_name* column (a real analysis would likely grab geographic variables too to see if changes depended on location, but here we're just using it as an example). The last two columns - *ori* and *agency_name* - aren't strictly necessary but would be useful for checking if an agency's values are reasonable (e.g. see if that agency had a sudden huge spike or decline in reported crimes) when checking for outliers, a step we won't do here. 

Before explaining how to subset from a data.frame, let's write pseudocode (essentially a description of what we are going to do that is readable to people but isn't real code) for our subset.

We want 

  * Only rows where the state equals Colorado
  * Only rows where the year is 2011-2017
  * Only the following columns: *actual_murder*, *state*, *year*, *population*, *ori*, *agency_name*

### Select specific columns

The way to select a specific column in R is called the dollar sign notation. 

`data$column`

We write the data name followed by a `$` and then the column name. Make sure there are no spaces, quotation marks, or misspellings (or capitalization issues). Just the `data$column` exactly as it is spelled. Since we are referring to data already read into R, there should not be any quotes for either the data or the column name. 

We can do this for the column *agency_name* in our UCR data. If we wrote this in the console it would print out every single row in the column. Because this data is large (over a million rows), I am going to wrap this in `head()` so it only displays the first 6 rows of the column rather than printing the entire column.

```{r}
head(ucr$agency_name)
```

They're all the same name because Anchorage Police reported many times and are in the data set multiple times. Let's look at the column *actual_murder*, which shows the annual number of murders in that agency. 

```{r}
head(ucr$actual_murder)
```

One hint is to write out the data set name in the console and hit the Tab key. Wait a couple of seconds and a popup will appear listing every column in the data set. You can scroll through this and then hit enter to select that column.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('images/tab_example.PNG')
```

### Select specific rows

In the earlier examples, we used square bracket notation `[]` and just put a number or several numbers in the `[]`. When dealing with data.frames, however, you need an extra step to tell R which columns to keep. The syntax in the square bracket is 

`[row, column]`

We start the square bracket by saying which row we want. Now, since we also have to consider the columns, we need to tell it the number or name (in a vector using `c()` if more than one name and putting column names in quotes) of the column or columns we want. 

The exception to this is when we use the dollar sign notation to select a single column. In that case we don't need a comma (and indeed it will give us an error!). Let's see a few examples and then explain why this works the way it does. 

```{r}
ucr[1, 1]
```

If we input multiple numbers, we can get multiple rows and columns.

```{r}
ucr[1:6, 1:6]
```

The column section also accepts a vector of the names of the columns. These names must be spelled correctly and in quotes.

```{r}
ucr[1:6, c("ori", "year")]
```


In cases where we want every row or every column, we just don't put a number. By default, R will return every row/column if you don't specify which ones you want. However, you will still need to include the comma.

Here is every column in the first row. Again, for real work we'd likely not do this as it will print out hundreds of rows to the console.

```{r}
ucr[1, ]
```

Since there are 223 columns in our data, normally we'd want to avoid printing out all of them. And in most cases, we would save the output of subsets to a new object to be used later rather than just printing the output in the console. 

What happens if we forget the comma? If we put in numbers for both rows and columns but don't include a comma between them it will have an error.

```{r error = TRUE}
ucr[1 1]
```

If we only put in a single number and no comma, it will return the column that matches that number. Here we have number 1 and it will return the first column. We'll wrap it in `head()` so it doesn't print out a million rows.

```{r}
head(ucr[1])
```

Since R thinks you are requesting a column, and we only have 223 columns in the data, asking for any number above 223 will return an error.

```{r error = TRUE}
head(ucr[1000])
```

If you already specify a column using dollar sign notation `$`, you do not need to indicate any column in the square brackets`[]`. All you need to do is say which row or rows you want. 

```{r}
ucr$agency_name[15]
```

### Subset Colorado data

Now we have the tools to subset our UCR data to just be Colorado from 2011-2017. There are three conditional statements we need to make, two for rows and one for columns.

  * Only rows where the state equals Colorado
  * Only rows where the year is 2011-2017
  * Only the following columns: actual_murder, state, year, population, ori, agency_name

We could use the `&` operator to say rows must meet condition 1 and condition 2. Since this is an intro lesson, we will do them as two separate conditional statements. For the first step we want to get all rows in the data where the state equals "colorado" (in this data all state names are lowercase). And at this point we want to keep all columns in the data. So let's make a new object called *colorado* to save the result of this subset.

Remember that we want to put the object to the left of the `[]` (and touching the `[]`) to make sure it returns the data. Just having the conditional statement will only return TRUE or FALSE values. Since we want all columns, we don't need to put anything after the comma (but we must include the comma!).

```{r}
colorado <- ucr[ucr$state == "colorado", ]
```

Now we want to get all the rows where the year is 2011-2017. Since we want to check if the year is one of the years 2011-2017, we will use `%in%` and put the years in a vector `2011:2017`. This time our primary data set is *colorado*, not *ucr* since *colorado* has already subsetted to just the state we want. This is how subsetting generally works. You take a large data set, subset it to a smaller one and continue to subset the smaller one to only the data you want. 

```{r}
colorado <- colorado[colorado$year %in% 2011:2017, ]
```

Finally we want the columns stated above and to keep every row in the current data. Since the format is `[row, column]` in this case we keep the "row" part blank to indicate that we want every row.

```{r}
colorado <- colorado[ , c("actual_murder", 
                          "state",
                          "year",
                          "population",
                          "ori", 
                          "agency_name")]
```

We can do a quick check using the `unique()` function. The `unique()` function prints all the unique values in a category, such as a column. We will use it on the *state* and *year* columns to make sure only the values that we want are present.

```{r}
unique(colorado$state)
```

```{r}
unique(colorado$year)
```

The only state is Colorado and the only years are 2011-2017 so our subset worked! This data shows the number of murders in each agency. We want to look at state trends so in Section \@ref(aggregate) we will sum up all the murders per year and see if marijuana legalization affected it. 

#### Subsetting using `dplyr`

Above, we did subsetting through what's called the "base R" method. "Base R" just means that we use functions that are built into R and don't use any packages. A very popular alternative way to do most of the work done in this chapter is to use the `dplyr` package. `dplyr` is a very useful package to handle data and includes functions that let us subset data, select only certain columns, and aggregate the data. For the package's website, which covers all of the features in this package, please see [here.](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) 

`dplyr` is part of what is called the "tidyverse," which is a collection of R packages written by mostly the same people that include lots of functions that are useful for working with the kind of data we use in this book. We'll cover many of the tidyverse packages in this book. There's nothing special about a package being a "tidyverse" package; they operate exactly the same as other packages. I just mention it because it is a very popular set of packages, and people will often talk about "tidyverse" approaches to R meaning using these packages. So it's good to know the terminology. To look at the full list of tidyverse packages, their website [here](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) is an excellent overview of them. 

In a lot of ways the functions we'll use from `dplyr` are simpler and easier to use than what we wrote earlier in this chapter. In fact, a lot of people learn only `dplyr` functions and do not learn (or at least do not spend much time on) base R. For the rest of this book we'll use base R and tidyverse functions alongside each other. I do this for two reasons. First, it's important to understand how R works and using base R is the best way to learn. This is a programming-for-a-purpose book, not a pure programming book, so the focus isn't on knowing all the ins and outs of R. However, I think it is still important to have some understanding of how R works and tidyverse functions tend to obfuscate that. 

In most cases this obfuscation is a good thing as it lets you focus on working with the data instead of thinking about how R works (and this is one of the tidyverse authors' motivations behind their work). In some cases, however, you'll encounter issues with either the code or your data where its important to understand how R works. In these (luckily relatively) rare cases, base R tends to be more useful in solving these problems than the tidyverse.

The second reason is that base R functions are incredibly stable. Most haven't changed since R was first created in the early 1990s. The benefit is that code you write using base R functions will work for a very long time. Using packages outside of base R (all packages, not just tidyverse packages) always carries the risk that a new version of the package will change the behavior of a function, or remove that function entirely. Thankfully this is quite rare as package developers often take care to ensure that old features remain available even as they update their package. But it is always a risk, and for programming for research we want to try to make our code as reproducible as possible, which means trying to ensure that functions we use will keep working in the future. That said, please don't avoid packages too much out of fear of this issue. Packages in R are enormously useful, and we'll use many of them throughout this book. 

We'll cover two functions from `dplyr` here, and we'll also cover a couple more in the next chapter. For now, we'll look only at `filter()` and `select()`. The `filter()` function is how `dplyr` does subsetting. It takes a conditional statement and "filters" the data to only return rows where that conditional statement is true. You can include multiple conditional statements in the parentheses of `filter()` and it'll return only rows where all of the statements are true. The `select()` function does roughly that with columns where we can input a conditional statement about the name of the column (e.g. columns ending in "rate") and it'll return only those columns. `select()` also lets you choose columns just by putting the name of the column(s) in the parentheses and that's all we'll be using it for here.
 
Let's first copy back some of the code we used earlier when we used base R to subset Colorado data from the UCR data set. 

```{r}
colorado <- ucr[ucr$state == "colorado", ]
colorado <- colorado[colorado$year %in% 2011:2017, ]
colorado <- colorado[ , c("actual_murder",
                          "state",
                          "year",
                          "population",
                          "ori",
                          "agency_name")]

We have two conditional statements - keep only rows where state is Colorado and where years are between 2011 and 2017 (including 2017) - and then we kept only a small number of columns.

We'll do this one step at a time using the `dplyr` functions. For `filter()` we first include the name of our data.frame, which in this case starts as "ucr" and then becomes "colorado" as we make a new object during the first line of code, and then we include our conditional statement. Using base R, we have to say which data.frame we used every time we included a column. Using `filter()` we don't need to do this. `filter()` is smart enough to select the column from the data.frame we input.

For our first filter we can write `filter(ucr, state == "colorado")` and we will save the resulting object into a data set called "colorado" like we did above. To use any `dplyr` functions we first need to install that package and then tell R we want to use it through the `library()` function.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("dplyr")
```


```{r}
library(dplyr)
colorado <- filter(ucr, state == "colorado")
```

Now we can do our second conditional statement where we keep only years 2011 through 2017.

```{r}
colorado <- filter(ucr, year %in% 2011:2017)
```

If we wanted to, we could combine these lines of code into a single line by including both conditional statements into a single `filter()` function by just including a comma after the first statement.

```{r}
colorado <- filter(ucr, state == "colorado", year %in% 2011:2017)
```

We follow similar syntax for `select()` by starting with the name of the data set and then the name of every column you want to keep. Unlike in base R we don't need to put the columns in a vector or to put the names in quotes (though you can put the names in quotes if you'd like). The order you put the column names in is also the order it will arrange them, so this function can be used to reorder your columns. 

```{r}
colorado <- select(colorado, actual_murder, state,
                   year, population, ori, agency_name)
```

If we run the same checks on unique states and years as we did after our base R code, we'll get the same results. This shows that our `dplyr` code did the same thing as our base R code.

```{r}
unique(colorado$state)
```

```{r}
unique(colorado$year)
```

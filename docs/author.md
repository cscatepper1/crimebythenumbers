# About the author (Jacob Kaplan) {-}

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Pennsylvania. I have a PhD and a master's degree in criminology from the University of Pennsylvania and a bachelor's degree in criminal justice from California State University, Sacramento. My research focuses on Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED), specifically on the effect of outdoor lighting on crime. I am the author of several R packages that make it easier to work with data, including  [fastDummies](https://jacobkap.github.io/fastDummies/) and [asciiSetupReader](https://jacobkap.github.io/asciiSetupReader/). My [website](http://jacobdkaplan.com/) allows easy analysis of crime-related data and I has released over a [dozen crime data sets](http://jacobdkaplan.com/data.html) (primarily FBI UCR data) on openICPSR that he has compiled, cleaned, and made available to the public.

# Introduction

At this point you have learned how to read in data, manipulate it to get just the parts you want or to aggregate it to the level you want, and visualize it through maps or graphs. You've done so using data sets that are commonly used in criminological research. In the next several chapters we will be introducing a number of other data - or looking deeper into data we've already seen - that is common in criminology. While these chapters do use R a bit to explore or read in the data, they are primarily a discussion of what the data has and what they don't have. Some of the data sets are difficult to read into R, requiring more steps than you may be useful, so these chapters will discuss how to get that data into R.

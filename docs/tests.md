## Tests for research projects

When you use R for a research project you'll usually take data that someone else collected, or scrape it yourself, do some work to clean this data (e.g. subset or aggregate the data, standardize values) and then run a regression on it. In these cases there are fewer opportunities to use unit tests to check your code. Indeed, the best checks are often content knowledge about the data and examining the results of the regression to see if it makes sense and fits prior literature.

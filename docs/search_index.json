We made the maps in a number of ways and consistently found that suicides were most prevalent in north and west Philly. In this lesson we will make choropleth maps, which are shaded maps where each “unit” is some known area such as a state or neighborhood. Think of election maps where states are colored blue when a Democratic candidate wins that state and red when a Republican candidate wins. These are choropleth maps - each state is colored to indicate something. In this lesson we will continue to work on the suicide data and make choropleth maps shaded by the number of suicides in each neighborhood (we will define this later in the lesson) in the city. Since we will be working more on the suicide data from San Francisco, let’s read it in now. library(readr) suicide &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/san_francisco_suicide_2003_2017.csv&quot;) #&gt; Parsed with column specification: #&gt; cols( #&gt; IncidntNum = col_double(), #&gt; Category = col_character(), #&gt; Descript = col_character(), #&gt; DayOfWeek = col_character(), #&gt; Date = col_character(), #&gt; Time = col_time(format = &quot;&quot;), #&gt; PdDistrict = col_character(), #&gt; Resolution = col_character(), #&gt; Address = col_character(), #&gt; X = col_double(), #&gt; Y = col_double(), #&gt; Location = col_character(), #&gt; PdId = col_double(), #&gt; year = col_double() #&gt; ) suicide &lt;- as.data.frame(suicide) The package that we will use to handle geographic data and do most of the work in this lesson is sf. sf is a sophisticated package and does far more than we will cover in this lesson. For more information about the package’s features please see the website for it here. install.packages(&quot;sf&quot;) library(sf) #&gt; Linking to GEOS 3.6.1, GDAL 2.2.3, PROJ 4.9.3 The way sf reads in the shapefiles is through the st_read() function. A shapefile is simialr to a data.frame but has information on how to draw a geographic boundary such as a state. Our input inside the () is a string with the name of the “.shp” file we want to read in (since we are telling R to read a file on the computer rather than an object that exists, it needs to be in quotes). This shapefile contains neighborhoods in San Francisco so we’ll call the object sf_neighborhoods\". sf_neighborhoods &lt;- st_read(&quot;data/san_francisco_neighborhoods.shp&quot;) #&gt; Reading layer `san_francisco_neighborhoods&#39; from data source `C:\\Users\\user\\Dropbox\\R_project\\r4crim\\data\\san_francisco_neighborhoods.shp&#39; using driver `ESRI Shapefile&#39; #&gt; Simple feature collection with 41 features and 1 field #&gt; geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON #&gt; dimension: XY #&gt; bbox: xmin: -122.5149 ymin: 37.70813 xmax: -122.357 ymax: 37.8333 #&gt; epsg (SRID): 4326 #&gt; proj4string: +proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +no_defs I downloaded this data from San Francisco’s Open Data site here, selecting the Shapefile format in the Export tab. If you do so yourself it’ll give you a zip file with multiple files in there. This is normal with shapefiles, you will have multiple files and only read in the file with the “.shp” extension to R. We still do need all of the files and st_read() is using them even if not explicitly called. So make sure every file downloaded is in the same working directory as the .shp file. The files from this site had hard to understand file names so I relabeled them all as “san_francisco_neighborhoods” though that doesn’t matter once it’s read into R. As usual when dealing with a new data set, let’s look at the first 6 rows. head(sf_neighborhoods) #&gt; Simple feature collection with 6 features and 1 field #&gt; geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON #&gt; dimension: XY #&gt; bbox: xmin: -122.4543 ymin: 37.70822 xmax: -122.357 ymax: 37.80602 #&gt; epsg (SRID): 4326 #&gt; proj4string: +proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +no_defs #&gt; nhood geometry #&gt; 1 Bayview Hunters Point MULTIPOLYGON (((-122.3816 3... #&gt; 2 Bernal Heights MULTIPOLYGON (((-122.4036 3... #&gt; 3 Castro/Upper Market MULTIPOLYGON (((-122.4266 3... #&gt; 4 Chinatown MULTIPOLYGON (((-122.4062 3... #&gt; 5 Excelsior MULTIPOLYGON (((-122.424 37... #&gt; 6 Financial District/South Beach MULTIPOLYGON (((-122.3875 3... The last column is important. In shapefiles the “geometry” column is the one with the instructions to make the map. This data has a single row for each neighborhood in the city. So the “geometry” column in each row have a list of coordinates which, if connected in order, make up that neighborhood. Since the “geometry” column contains the instructions to map, we can plot() it to show a map of the data. plot(sf_neighborhoods$geometry) Here we have a map of San Francisco broken up into neighborhoods. Is this a perfect representation of the neighborhoods in San Francisco? No. It is simply the city’s attempt to create definitions of neighborhoods. Indeed, you’re likely to find that areas at the border of neighborhoods are more similar to each other than they are to areas at the opposite side of their designated neighborhood. You can read a bit about how San Francisco determined the neighborhood boundaries here but know that this, like all geographic designated have some degree of inaccuracy and arbitrariness in it. Like many things in criminology, this is just another limitation we will have to keep in mind. In the head() results there was a section about something called “epsg” and “proj4string”. Let’s talk about that specifically since they are important for working with spatial data. A way to get just those two results in the st_crs() function which is part of sf. Let’s exneighborhood the “coordinate reference system” (CRS) for sf_neighborhoods. st_crs(sf_neighborhoods) Coordinate Reference System: EPSG: 4326 proj4string: &quot;+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +no_defs&quot; An issue with working with geographic data is that the Earth is not flat. Since the Earth is spherical, there will always be some distortion when trying to plot the data on a flat surface such as a map. To account for this we need to transform the longitude and latitude values we generally have to work properly on a map. We do so by “projecting” our data onto the areas of the Earth we want. This is a complex field with lots of work done on it (both absneighborhoodly and for R specifically) so this lesson will be an extremely brief overview of the topic and oversimplify some aspects of it. If we look at the output of st_crs(sf_neighborhoods) we can see that the EPSG is set to 4326 and the proj4string (which ittells us the current map projection) is “+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs”. This CRS, WGS84, is a standard CRS and is the one used whenever you use a GPS to find a location. To find the CRS for certain parts of the world see here. If you search that site for “California” you’ll see that California is broken into 6 zones. The site isn’t that helpful on which zones are which but some Googling can often find state or region maps with the zones depicted there. We want California zone 3 which has the EPSG code 2227. We’ll use this code to project this data properly. If we want to get the proj4string for 2227 we can use st_crs(2227) #&gt; Coordinate Reference System: #&gt; EPSG: 2227 #&gt; proj4string: &quot;+proj=lcc +lat_1=38.43333333333333 +lat_2=37.06666666666667 +lat_0=36.5 +lon_0=-120.5 +x_0=2000000.0001016 +y_0=500000.0001016001 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=us-ft +no_defs&quot; Note the section that says “+units=us-ft”. This means that the units are in feet. Some projections have units in meters so be mindful of this when doing some analysis such as seeing if a point is within X feet of a certain area. Let’s convert our sf_neighborhoods data to coordinate reference system 2227. sf_neighborhoods &lt;- st_transform(sf_neighborhoods, crs = 2227) st_crs(sf_neighborhoods) Coordinate Reference System: EPSG: 2227 proj4string: &quot;+proj=lcc +lat_1=38.43333333333333 +lat_2=37.06666666666667 +lat_0=36.5 +lon_0=-120.5 +x_0=2000000.0001016 +y_0=500000.0001016001 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=us-ft +no_defs&quot; 8.1 Spatial joins What we want to do with these neighborhoods is to find out which neighborhood each suicide occurred in and sum up the number of suicides per neighborhood. Once we do that we can make a more accurate hotspot map by mapping at the neighborhood level and being able to measure suicides-per-neighborhood. A spatial join is very similar to regular joins where we merge two data sets based on common variables (such as state name or unique ID code of a person). In this case it merges based on some shared geographic feature such as if two lines intersect or (as we will do so here) if a point is within some geographic area. Right now our suicide data is in a data.frame with some info on each suicides and the longitude and latitude of the suicide in separate columns. We want to turn this data.frame into a spatial object to allow us to find which neighborhood each suicide happened in. We can convert it into a spatial object using the st_as_sf() function from sf. Our input is first our data, suicide. Then in the coords parameter we put a vector of the column names so the function knows which columns are the longitude and latitude columns to convert to a “geometry” column like we saw in sf_neighborhoods earlier. We’ll set the CRS to be the WGS84 standard we saw earlier but we will change it to match the CRS that the neighborhood data has. suicide &lt;- st_as_sf(suicide, coords = c(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;), crs = &quot;+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +no_defs&quot;) We want our suicides data in the same projection as the neighborhoods data so we need to use st_transform() to change the projection. Since we want the CRS to be the same as in sf_neighborhoods, we can set it using st_crs(sf_neighborhoods) to use the right CRS. suicide &lt;- st_transform(suicide, crs = st_crs(sf_neighborhoods)) Now we can take a look at head() to see if it was projected. head(suicide) #&gt; Simple feature collection with 6 features and 12 fields #&gt; geometry type: POINT #&gt; dimension: XY #&gt; bbox: xmin: 5986822 ymin: 2091310 xmax: 6013739 ymax: 2117180 #&gt; epsg (SRID): 2227 #&gt; proj4string: +proj=lcc +lat_1=38.43333333333333 +lat_2=37.06666666666667 +lat_0=36.5 +lon_0=-120.5 +x_0=2000000.0001016 +y_0=500000.0001016001 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=us-ft +no_defs #&gt; IncidntNum Category Descript DayOfWeek #&gt; 1 180318931 SUICIDE ATTEMPTED SUICIDE BY STRANGULATION Monday #&gt; 2 180315501 SUICIDE ATTEMPTED SUICIDE BY JUMPING Saturday #&gt; 3 180295674 SUICIDE SUICIDE BY LACERATION Saturday #&gt; 4 180263659 SUICIDE SUICIDE Tuesday #&gt; 5 180235523 SUICIDE ATTEMPTED SUICIDE BY INGESTION Friday #&gt; 6 180236515 SUICIDE SUICIDE BY ASPHYXIATION Thursday #&gt; Date Time PdDistrict Resolution Address #&gt; 1 04/30/2018 06:30:00 TARAVAL NONE 0 Block of BRUCE AV #&gt; 2 04/28/2018 17:54:00 NORTHERN NONE 700 Block of HAYES ST #&gt; 3 04/21/2018 12:20:00 RICHMOND NONE 3700 Block of CLAY ST #&gt; 4 04/10/2018 05:13:00 CENTRAL NONE 0 Block of DRUMM ST #&gt; 5 03/30/2018 09:15:00 TARAVAL NONE 0 Block of FAIRFIELD WY #&gt; 6 03/29/2018 17:30:00 RICHMOND NONE 300 Block of 29TH AV #&gt; Location PdId year #&gt; 1 POINT (-122.45168059935614 37.72218061554315) 1.803189e+13 2018 #&gt; 2 POINT (-122.42876060987851 37.77620120112792) 1.803155e+13 2018 #&gt; 3 POINT (-122.45462091999406 37.7881754224736) 1.802957e+13 2018 #&gt; 4 POINT (-122.39642194376758 37.79414474237039) 1.802637e+13 2018 #&gt; 5 POINT (-122.46324153155875 37.72679184368551) 1.802355e+13 2018 #&gt; 6 POINT (-122.48929119750689 37.782735835121265) 1.802365e+13 2018 #&gt; geometry #&gt; 1 POINT (5997229 2091310) #&gt; 2 POINT (6004262 2110838) #&gt; 3 POINT (5996881 2115353) #&gt; 4 POINT (6013739 2117180) #&gt; 5 POINT (5993921 2093059) #&gt; 6 POINT (5986822 2113584) We can see it is now a “simple feature collection” with the correct projection. And we can see there is a new column called “geometry” just like in sf_neighborhoods. The type of data in “geometry” is POINT since our data is just a single location instead of a polygon like in the neighborhoods data. Since we have both the neighborhoods and the suicides data let’s make a quick map to see the data. plot(sf_neighborhoods$geometry) plot(suicide$geometry, add = TRUE, col = &quot;red&quot;) Our next step is to combine these two data sets to figure out how many suicides occurred in each neighborhood. This will be a multi-step process so let’s plan it out before beginning. Our suicide data is one row for each suicide, our neighborhood data is one row for each neighborhood. Since our goal is to map at the neighborhood-level we need to get the neighborhood where each suicide occurred then aggregate up to the neighborhood-level to get a count of the suicides-per-neighborhood. Then we need to combine that with that the original neighborhood data (since we need the “geometry” column) and we can then map it. Find which neighborhood each suicide happened in Aggregate suicide data until we get one row per neighborhood and a column showing the number of suicides in that neighborhood Combine with the neighborhood data Make a map We’ll start by finding the neighborhood where each suicide occurred using the function st_join() which is a function in sf. This does a spatial join and finds the polygon where each point is located in. Since we will be aggregating the data let’s call the output of this function suicides_agg. The order in the () is important! For our aggregation we want the output to be at the suicide-level so we start with the suicide data. In the next step we’ll see why this matters. suicides_agg &lt;- st_join(suicide, sf_neighborhoods) Let’s look at the first 6 rows. head(suicides_agg) #&gt; Simple feature collection with 6 features and 13 fields #&gt; geometry type: POINT #&gt; dimension: XY #&gt; bbox: xmin: 5986822 ymin: 2091310 xmax: 6013739 ymax: 2117180 #&gt; epsg (SRID): 2227 #&gt; proj4string: +proj=lcc +lat_1=38.43333333333333 +lat_2=37.06666666666667 +lat_0=36.5 +lon_0=-120.5 +x_0=2000000.0001016 +y_0=500000.0001016001 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=us-ft +no_defs #&gt; IncidntNum Category Descript DayOfWeek #&gt; 1 180318931 SUICIDE ATTEMPTED SUICIDE BY STRANGULATION Monday #&gt; 2 180315501 SUICIDE ATTEMPTED SUICIDE BY JUMPING Saturday #&gt; 3 180295674 SUICIDE SUICIDE BY LACERATION Saturday #&gt; 4 180263659 SUICIDE SUICIDE Tuesday #&gt; 5 180235523 SUICIDE ATTEMPTED SUICIDE BY INGESTION Friday #&gt; 6 180236515 SUICIDE SUICIDE BY ASPHYXIATION Thursday #&gt; Date Time PdDistrict Resolution Address #&gt; 1 04/30/2018 06:30:00 TARAVAL NONE 0 Block of BRUCE AV #&gt; 2 04/28/2018 17:54:00 NORTHERN NONE 700 Block of HAYES ST #&gt; 3 04/21/2018 12:20:00 RICHMOND NONE 3700 Block of CLAY ST #&gt; 4 04/10/2018 05:13:00 CENTRAL NONE 0 Block of DRUMM ST #&gt; 5 03/30/2018 09:15:00 TARAVAL NONE 0 Block of FAIRFIELD WY #&gt; 6 03/29/2018 17:30:00 RICHMOND NONE 300 Block of 29TH AV #&gt; Location PdId year #&gt; 1 POINT (-122.45168059935614 37.72218061554315) 1.803189e+13 2018 #&gt; 2 POINT (-122.42876060987851 37.77620120112792) 1.803155e+13 2018 #&gt; 3 POINT (-122.45462091999406 37.7881754224736) 1.802957e+13 2018 #&gt; 4 POINT (-122.39642194376758 37.79414474237039) 1.802637e+13 2018 #&gt; 5 POINT (-122.46324153155875 37.72679184368551) 1.802355e+13 2018 #&gt; 6 POINT (-122.48929119750689 37.782735835121265) 1.802365e+13 2018 #&gt; nhood geometry #&gt; 1 Oceanview/Merced/Ingleside POINT (5997229 2091310) #&gt; 2 Hayes Valley POINT (6004262 2110838) #&gt; 3 Presidio Heights POINT (5996881 2115353) #&gt; 4 Financial District/South Beach POINT (6013739 2117180) #&gt; 5 West of Twin Peaks POINT (5993921 2093059) #&gt; 6 Outer Richmond POINT (5986822 2113584) There is now the “nhood” column from the neighborhoods data which says which neighborhood the suicide happened in. Now we can aggregate up to the neighborhood-level. For now we will use the code to aggregate the number of suicides per neighborhood. Remember, the aggregate() command aggregates a numeric value by some categorical value. Here we aggregate the number of suicides per neighborhood. So our code will be aggregate(number_suicides ~ nhood, data = suicides_agg, FUN = sum) We actually don’t have a variable with the number of suicides so we need to make that. We can simply call it number_suicides and give it that value of 1 since each row is only one suicide. suicides_agg$number_suicides &lt;- 1 Now we can write the aggregate() code and save the results back into suicides_agg. suicides_agg &lt;- aggregate(number_suicides ~ nhood, data = suicides_agg, FUN = sum) Let’s check a summary of the number_suicides variable we made. summary(suicides_agg$number_suicides) #&gt; Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. #&gt; 1.00 15.00 24.00 33.08 38.50 141.00 The minimum is one suicide per neighborhood, 33 on average, and 141 in the neighborhood with the most suicides. So what do we make of this data? Well, there are some data issues that cause problems in these results. Let’s think about the minimum value. Did every single neighborhood in the city have at least one suicide? No, take a look at the number of rows in this data, keeping in mind there should be one row per neighborhood. nrow(suicides_agg) #&gt; [1] 39 And let’s compare it to the sf_neighborhoods data. nrow(sf_neighborhoods) #&gt; [1] 41 The suicides data is missing 2 neighborhoods. That is because if no suicide occurred there, there would never be a matching row in the data so that neighborhood wouldn’t appear in the suicide data. That’s not going to be a major issue here but is something to keep in mind in future research. The data is ready to merge with the sf_neighborhoods data. We’ll introduce a new function that makes merging data simple. This function comes from the dplyr package so we need to install and tell R we want to use it using library(). install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;) library(dplyr) #&gt; #&gt; Attaching package: &#39;dplyr&#39; #&gt; The following objects are masked from &#39;package:stats&#39;: #&gt; #&gt; filter, lag #&gt; The following objects are masked from &#39;package:base&#39;: #&gt; #&gt; intersect, setdiff, setequal, union The function we will use is left_join() which takes two parameters, the two data sets to join together. left_join(data1, data2) This function joins these data and keeps all of the rows from the left data and every column from both data sets. It combines the data based on any matching columns (matching meaning same column name) in both data sets. Since in our data sets, the column “nhood” exists in both, it will merge the data based on that column. There are two other functions that are similar but differ based on which rows they keep. left_join - All rows from Left data and all columns from Left and Right data right_join - All rows from Right data and all columns from Left and Right data full_join - All rows and all columns from Left and Right data We could alternatively use the merge() function which is built into R but that function is slower than the dplyr functions and requires us to manually set the matching columns. We want to keep all rows in sf_neighborhoods (keep all neighborhoods) so we can use left_join(sf_neighborhoods, suicides_agg). Let’s save the results into a new data.frame called sf_neighborhoods_suicides\". sf_neighborhoods_suicides &lt;- left_join(sf_neighborhoods, suicides_agg) #&gt; Joining, by = &quot;nhood&quot; If we look at summary() again for number_suicides we can see that there are now 2 rows with NAs. These are the neighborhoods where there were no suicides so they weren’t present in the suicides_agg data. summary(sf_neighborhoods_suicides$number_suicides) #&gt; Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. NA&#39;s #&gt; 1.00 15.00 24.00 33.08 38.50 141.00 2 We need to convert these values to 0. We will use the is.na() function to conditionally find all rows with a NA value in the number_suicides column and use square bracket notation to change the value to 0. sf_neighborhoods_suicides$number_suicides[is.na(sf_neighborhoods_suicides$number_suicides)] &lt;- 0 Checking it again we see that the minimum is now 0 and the mean number of suicides decreases a bit to about 31.5 per neighborhood. summary(sf_neighborhoods_suicides$number_suicides) #&gt; Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. #&gt; 0.00 12.00 23.00 31.46 36.00 141.00 8.2 Making choropleth maps Finally we are ready to make some choropleth maps. For these maps we are going to use ggplot2 again so we need to load it. library(ggplot2) ggplot2’s benefit is you can slowly build graphs or maps and improve the graph at every step. Earlier we used functions such as geom_line() for line graphs and geom_point() for scatter plots. For mapping these polygons we will use geom_sf() which knows how to handle spatial data. As usual we will start with ggplot(), inputting our data first. Then inside of aes (the aesthetics of the graph/map) we use a new parameter fill. In fill we will put in the number_suicides column and it will color the polygons (neighborhoods) based on values in that column. Then we can add the geom_sf(). ggplot(sf_neighborhoods_suicides, aes(fill = number_suicides)) + geom_sf() We have now created a choropleth map showing the number of suicides per neighborhood in San Francisco! Based on the legend neighborhoods that are light blue have the most suicides while neighborhoods that are dark blue have the fewest (or none at all). Normally we’d want the opposite, with darker (or brighter) areas signifying a greater amount of whatever the map is showing. We can use scale_fill_gradient() to set the colors to what we want. We input a color for low value and a color for high value and it’ll make the map shade by those colors. ggplot(sf_neighborhoods_suicides, aes(fill = number_suicides)) + geom_sf() + scale_fill_gradient(low = &quot;white&quot;, high = &quot;red&quot;) This gives a much better map and clearly shows the areas where suicides are most common and where there were no suicides. To make this map easier to read and look better, let’s add a title to the map and to the legend. ggplot(sf_neighborhoods_suicides, aes(fill = number_suicides)) + geom_sf() + scale_fill_gradient(low = &quot;white&quot;, high = &quot;red&quot;) + labs(fill = &quot;# of suicides&quot;, title = &quot;Suicides in San Francisco, by neighborhood&quot;, subtitle = &quot;2003 - 2017&quot;) Since the coordinates don’t add anything to the map, let’s get rid of them. ggplot(sf_neighborhoods_suicides, aes(fill = number_suicides)) + geom_sf() + scale_fill_gradient(low = &quot;white&quot;, high = &quot;red&quot;) + labs(fill = &quot;# of suicides&quot;, title = &quot;Suicides in San Francisco, by neighborhood&quot;, subtitle = &quot;2003 - 2017&quot;) + theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.text.y = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank()) "]

["scrape-table2.html", "16 More Scraping tables from PDFs", " 16 More Scraping tables from PDFs In Chapter 15 we used the package pdftools to scrape tables on arrests/seizures from the United States Border Patrol that were only available in a PDF. Given the importance of PDF scraping - hopefully by the time you read this chapter more data will be available in reasonable formats and not in PDFs - in this chapter we’ll continue working on scraping tables from PDFs. Here we will use the package tabulizer which has a number of features making it especially useful for grabbing tables from PDFs. One issue which we saw in Chapter 15 is that the table may not be the only thing on the page - the page could also have a title, page number etc. When using pdftools we use regular expressions and subsetting to remove all the extra lines. Using tabulizer we can simply say (through a handy function) that we only want a part of the page, so we only scrape the table itself. For more info about the tabulizer package please see their site here. For this chapter we’ll scrape data from the Pennsylvania Commission on Sentencing’s Sentencing Guidelines (available here. Sentencing guidelines are basically just a simple series of conditional statements that add up (each TRUE statement is literally given a numerical value) and then judges used the guidelines based on the final number value for the defendant. As an example, per the guidelines if a person is charged with a Felony 1 offenses (i.e. the second most serious kind of felony) that is worth 7 points. If this person has a prior record of a Felony 2 crime, add 2 points to the score. Assuming nothing else in the guidelines applies to this person, they now have 9 points and score, in combination with the current offense, affects the recommended sentence they receive. This PDF is 100 pages and only about a quarter of that is discussing the guidelines and what criteria a person has to meet to be given a certain score.1 After this section is about 70 pages of tables which have the crime code (e.g. 3802 (f)(2)), the crime in plain English (e.g. DUI-commercial/school vehicles &amp; incapable of safe driving (minor occupant; 1st/2nd off)), an indicator or what level of offense (e.g. Felony 1, Felony 2, Misdemeanor 3, etc.), the number of points a person receives for being charged with this crime, and the number of points a person receives for having a prior record of this offense. First, open this PDF in your web browser While this technique If you don’t have this package installed you’ll need to install it using install.packages(\"tabulizer\"). library(tabulizer) I recommend reading/skimming this section - or your own state’s sentencing guidelines - to get a better understanding of what they entail.↩︎ "]

# Welcome {-}

These notes introduce the programming language R and are meant for undergrads or graduate students studying criminology. While R is a useful tool for any field of study, this book focuses on the skills criminologists should know and uses crime data as the example data sets. For most of the lessons we will be working through real research questions such as "what do victims of murder look like?" and "are Pennsylvanians drinking more beer than they used to?" and "where do police shootings occur in Philadelphia?" This book will also cover the following skills in R: regular expressions, webscraping, mapping and handling geographic data, and basic data coding skills. It will also cover some important official crime data sources such as UCR, NIBRS, and the Census.

This book is based off of the lessons I took as a Master's student in criminology at Penn from [Dr. Greg Ridgeway](https://crim.sas.upenn.edu/people/greg-ridgeway). While the code and some of the packages are different, the basic philosophy of teaching by example and a focus on the fundamentals of R (and programming in general) are the same. For Dr. Ridgeway's R lessons, please see [here](https://github.com/gregridgeway/R4crim) .

# Census Data from IPUMS

In Chapter \@ref(choropleth-maps) we used the website Social Explorer to look at Census data at the Census tract level. This is a tool to quickly get Census data without writing too much code. As mentioned earlier, there are a number of limitations to this tool. Primarily that we are limited to just the variables it decides to give us. If we want other variables, or combinations of variables, we need to use another tool.

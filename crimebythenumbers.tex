This book introduces the programming language R and is meant
for undergrads or graduate students studying criminology. R
is a programming language that is well-suited to the type of
work frequently done in criminology - taking messy data and
turning it into useful information. While R is a useful tool
for many fields of study, this book focuses on the skills
criminologists should know and uses crime data for the
example data sets.

For this book you should have the latest version of
\href{https://cloud.r-project.org/}{R} installed and be
running it through
\href{https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/}{RStudio
Desktop (The free version)}. We'll get into detail on what R
and RStudio are soon but please have them both installed to
be able to follow along with each chapter. While you must
install both, you only ever need to open RStudio. While R is
the actual programming language, RStudio is program that
makes it a lot easier to interact with R than opening up the
R application itself.\footnote{This is formally known as an
  ``integrated development environment'' or an IDE.} I
highly recommend following along with the code for each
lesson and then trying to use the lessons learned on a data
set that you are interested in.

\hypertarget{why-learn-to-program}{%
\section*{Why learn to
program?}\label{why-learn-to-program}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Why learn to program?}

With the exception of some more advanced techniques like
scraping data from websites or from PDFs, nearly everything
we do here can be done through Excel, a software you're
probably more familiar with. The basic steps for research
projects are generally:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Open up a data set - which frequently comes as an Excel
  file!
\item
  Change some values - misspellings or too specific
  categories for our purposes are very common in crime data
\item
  Delete some values - such as states you won't be studying
\item
  Make some graphs
\item
  Calculate some values - such as number of crimes per year
\item
  Sometimes do a statistical analysis depending on the type
  of project
\item
  Write up what you find
\end{enumerate}

R can do all of this but why should you want (or have) to
learn an entirely new skill just to do something you can
already do? R is useful for two main reasons: scale and
reproducibility.

\hypertarget{scale}{%
\subsection*{Scale}\label{scale}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Scale}

If you do a one-off project in your career such as
downloading some data and making a graph out of it, it makes
sense to stick with software like Excel. The cost (in time
and effort) of learning R is certainly not worth it for a
single (or even several) project - even one perfectly suited
for using R. R (and many programming languages more
generally, such as Python) has its strength in doing
something fairly simple many times. For example, it may be
quicker to download one file yourself than it is to write
the code in R to download that file. But when it comes to
downloading hundreds of files, writing the R code becomes
very quickly the better option than doing it by hand.

For most tasks you do in research when dealing with data,
you will end up doing them many times (including doing the
same task in future projects). So R offers the trade-off of
spending time upfront by learning the code with the benefit
of that code being able to do work at a large scale with
little extra work from you. Please keep in mind this
trade-off - you need to front-load the costs of learning R
for the rewards of making your life easier when dealing with
data - when feeling discouraged about the small returns you
get early in learning R.

\hypertarget{reproducibility}{%
\subsection*{Reproducibility}\label{reproducibility}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Reproducibility}

The second major benefit of using R over something like
Excel is that R is reproducible. Every action you take is
written down. This is useful when collaborating with others
(including your future self) as they can look at your code
and follow along what you did without you having to show
them every click you made as you frequently would on Excel.
Your collaborator can look at your code to help you figure
out a bug in the code or add their own code to yours.

In the research context specifically, you want to have code
to give to people to ensure that your research was done
correctly and there aren't bugs in the code. Additionally,
if you build a tool to, for example, interpret raw crime
data from an agency and turn it into a map, being able to
share the code so others can modify it for their own city
saves these people a lot of time and effort.

While not required (yet) in criminology, some academic
journals (such as in economics) even require that you submit
your data and code if your paper is accepted. If criminology
follows in this trend, or if you submit to journals that
require code submissions, you'll need to be able to write
code and not rely on software that doesn't track your steps
(such as Excel and SPSS).

\hypertarget{what-you-will-learn}{%
\section*{What you will learn}\label{what-you-will-learn}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{What you will learn}

For many of the lessons we will be working through real
research questions and working from start to finish as you
would on your own project. This involves thinking about what
you want to accomplish from the data you have and what steps
you need to take to reach that goal. This involves more than
just knowing what code to write - it includes figuring out
what your data has, whether it can answer the question
you're asking, and planning out (without writing any code
yet) what you need to do when you start coding. For most
lessons we'll be using actual crime data that is commonly
used in research so you'll become acquainted to a number of
important data sets.

\hypertarget{skills}{%
\subsection*{Skills}\label{skills}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Skills}

There is a large range of skills in criminology research -
far too large to cover in a single book. Here we will
attempt to teach fundamental skills to build a solid
foundation for future work. We'll be focusing on the
following skills and trying to reinforce our skills with
each lesson.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Subsetting - Taking only certain rows or columns from a
  data set
\item
  Graphing
\item
  Regular expressions - Essentially R's ``Find and Replace''
  function for text
\item
  Getting data from websites (webscraping)
\item
  Getting data from PDFs (PDF scraping)
\item
  Mapping
\item
  Writing documents through R
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{what-you-wont-learn}{%
\section*{What you won't learn}\label{what-you-wont-learn}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{What you won't learn}

This book is not a statistics book so we will not be
covering any statistical techniques. Though some data sets
we handle are fairly large, this book does not discuss how
to deal with Big Data. While the lessons you learn in this
book can apply to larger data sets, Big Data (which I tend
to define loosely as data that are too large for my computer
to handle) requires special skills that are outside the
realm of this book. If you do intend to deal with huge data
sets I recommend you look at the R package
\href{https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki}{data.table}
which is an excellent resource for it. While we briefly
cover mapping, this book will not cover working with
geographic data in detail. For a comprehensive look at
geographic data please see this
\href{https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/}{book}. This book
also will not cover any qualitative data or analysis. While
qualitative research is an important part of criminology,
this book only focuses on working with quantitative data.
Some parts of this book may apply to dealing with
qualitative data, such as PDF scraping and regular
expressions, but the examples I use in those chapters still
deal with quantitative data.

\hypertarget{simple-vs-easy}{%
\section*{Simple vs Easy}\label{simple-vs-easy}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Simple vs Easy}

In the course of this book we will cover things that are
very simple. For example, we'll take a data set (think of it
like an Excel file) with crime for nearly every police
agency in the United States and keep only data from Colorado
for a small number of years. We'll then find out how many
murders happened in Colorado each year. This is a fairly
simple task - it can be expressed in two sentences. You'll
find that most of what you do is simple like this - it is
quick to talk about what you are doing and the concepts are
not complicated. What it isn't is easy. To actually write
the R code to do this takes knowing a number of interrelated
concepts in R and several lines of code to implement each
step.

While this distinction may seem minor, I think it is
important for newer programmers to understand that what they
are doing may be simple to talk about but hard to implement.
It is easy to feel like a bad programmer because something
that can be articulated in 10 seconds may take hours to do.
So during times when you are working with R try to keep in
mind that even though a project may be simple to articulate,
it may be hard to code and that there is often very little
correlation between the two.

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{How to read this book}

This book is written so a person who has no programming
experience can start with this chapter and by the end of the
book be able to do a data project from start to finish. Each
chapter introduces a new skill and builds on the skills
introduced in previous chapters. So if you skip ahead you
may miss important skills taught in the chapters you didn't
read. For someone who has no - or minimal - programming
experience, I recommend reading each chapter in order. If
you have more programming experience and just want to learn
how to do a specific thing, feel free to skip directly to
that chapter.

available to you to run. To download the files, please go to
the book's GitHub page
\href{https://github.com/jacobkap/crimebythenumbers/tree/master/code_repository}{here}.
I've saved each chapter twice - once where it only includes
the code used (in the ``just\_code'' folder) and once where
it includes the code and all of the text in the chapter (in
the ``code\_and\_text'' folder). So download whichever one
you want to use. The code is identical in each.

\hypertarget{interactive-maps}{%
\chapter{Interactive maps}\label{interactive-maps}}

For this chapter you'll need the following files, which are
available for download
\href{https://github.com/jacobkap/r4crimz/tree/master/data}{here}:
san\_francisco\_marijuana\_geocoded.csv and
sf\_neighborhoods\_suicide.rda.

While maps of data are useful, their ability to show
incident-level information is quite limited. They tend to
show broad trends - where crime happened in a city - rather
than provide information about specific crime incidents.
While broad trends are important, there are significant
drawbacks about being unable to get important information
about an incident without having to check the data. An
interactive map bridges this gap by showing trends while
allowing you to zoom into individual incidents and see
information about each incident.

For this lesson we will be using data on every marijuana
dispensary in San Francisco that has an active dispensary
license as of late September 2019. The file is called
``san\_francisco\_marijuana\_geocoded.csv''.

When downloaded from California's Bureau of Cannabis Control
(\href{https://aca5.accela.com/bcc/customization/bcc/cap/licenseSearch.aspx}{here}
if you're interested) the data contains the address of each
dispensary but does not have coordinates. Without
coordinates we are unable to map points, meaning we need to
geocode them. Geocoding is the process of taking an address
and getting the longitude and latitude of that address for
mapping. For this lesson I've already geocoded the data and
we'll learn how to do so in Chapter @ref(geocoding).

\hypertarget{understanding-your-data}{%
\subsection{Understanding your
data}\label{understanding-your-data}}

The most important thing to learn from this book is that
understanding your data is crucial to good research. Making
interactive maps is a very useful way to better understand
your data as you can immediately see geographic patterns and
quickly look at characteristics of those incidents to
understand them.

In this lesson we will make a map of each marijuana
dispensary in San Francisco that lets you click on the
dispensary and see some information about it. If we see a
cluster of dispensaries, we can click on each one to see if
they are similar - for example if owned by the same person.
Though it is possible to find these patterns just looking at
the data, it is easier to be able to see a geographic
pattern and immediately look at information about each
incident.

\hypertarget{police-departments-use-them}{%
\subsection{Police departments use
them}\label{police-departments-use-them}}

Interactive maps are popular in large police departments
such as Philadelphia and New York City. They allow easy
understanding of geographic patterns in the data and,
importantly, allow such access to people who do not have the
technical skills necessary to interact with the data itself.
If nothing else, learning interactive maps may help you with
a future job.

This data has information about the type of license, who the
owner is, and where the dispensary is (as an address and as
coordinates). We'll be making a map showing every dispensary
in the city and make it so when you click a dot it'll make a
popup showing information about that dispensary.

We will use the package \texttt{leaflet} for our interactive
map. \texttt{leaflet} produces maps similar to Google Maps
with circles (or any icon we choose) for each value we add
to the map. It allows you to zoom in, scroll around, and
provides context to each incident that isn't available on a
static map.

To make a \texttt{leaflet} map we need to run the function
\texttt{leaflet()} and add a tile to the map. A tile is
simply the background of the map. This
\href{https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/}{website}
provides a large number of potential tiles to use, though
many are not relevant to our purposes of crime mapping.

We will use a standard tile from Open Street Maps. This tile
gives street names and highlights important features such as
parks and large stores which provides useful contexts for
looking at the data. The \texttt{attribution} parameter
isn't strictly necessary but it is good form to say where
your tile is from.

When you run the above code it shows a world map (copied
several times). Zoom into it and it'll start showing
relevant features of wherever you're looking.

Note the \texttt{\%\textgreater{}\%} between the
\texttt{leaflet()} function and the \texttt{addTiles()}
function. \texttt{leaflet} is one of the packages in R where
we can use pipes.

To add the points to the graph we use the function
\texttt{addMarkers()} which has two parameters, \texttt{lng}
and \texttt{lat}. For both parameters we put the column in
which the longitude and latitude are, respectively.

It now adds an icon indicating where every dispensary in our
data is. You can zoom in and scroll around to see more about
where the dispensaries are. There are only a few dozen
locations in the data so the popups overlapping a bit
doesn't affect our map too much. If we had more - such as
crime data with millions of offenses - it would make it very
hard to read. To change the icons to circles we can change
the function \texttt{addMarkers()} to
\texttt{addCircleMarkers()}, keeping the rest of the code
the same.

This makes the icon into circles which take up less space
than icons. To adjust the size of our icons we use the
\texttt{radius} parameter in \texttt{addMarkers()} or
\texttt{addCircleMarkers()}. The larger the radius, the
larger the icons.

Setting the \texttt{radius} option to 5 shrinks the size of
the icon a lot. In your own maps you'll have to fiddle with
this option to get it to look the way you want. Let's move
on to adding information about each icon when clicked upon.

\hypertarget{adding-popup-information}{%
\section{Adding popup
information}\label{adding-popup-information}}

The parameter \texttt{popup} in the \texttt{addMarkers()} or
\texttt{addCircleMarkers()} functions lets you input a
character value (if not already a character value it will
convert it to one) and that will be shown as a popup when
you click on the icon. Let's start simple here by inputting
the business owner column in our data and then build it up
to a more complicated popup.

Try clicking around and you'll see that the owner of the
dispensary you clicked on appears over the dot. We usually
want to have a title indicating what the value in the popup
means. We can do this by using the \texttt{paste()} function
to combine text explaining the value with the value itself.
Let's add the words ``Business Owner:'' before the business
owner column.

Just adding the location text makes it try to print out
everything on one line which is hard to read. If we add the
text \texttt{\textless{}br\textgreater{}} where we want a
line break it will make one.
\texttt{\textless{}br\textgreater{}} is the HTML tag for
line-break which is why it works making a new line in this
case.

In our case with only 33 rows of data, turning the markers
to circles solves our visibility issue. In cases with many
more rows of data, this doesn't always work. A solution for
this is to cluster the data into groups where the dots only
show if you zoom in.

If we add the code
\texttt{clusterOptions\ =\ markerClusterOptions()} to our
\texttt{addCircleMarkers()} it will cluster for us.

Locations close to each other are grouped together in fairly
arbitrary groupings and we can see how large each grouping
is by moving our cursor over the circle. Click on a circle
or zoom in and it will show smaller groupings at lower
levels of aggregation. Keep clicking or zooming in and it
will eventually show each location as its own circle.

This method is very useful for dealing with huge amounts of
data as it avoids overflowing the map with too many icons at
one time. A downside, however, is that the clusters are
created arbitrarily meaning that important context, such as
neighborhood, can be lost.

\hypertarget{interactive-choropleth-maps}{%

In Chapter @ref(choropleth-maps) we worked on choropleth
maps which are maps with shaded regions, such as states
colored by which political party won them in an election.
Here we will make interactive choropleth maps where you can
click on a shaded region and see information about that
region. We'll make the same map as before - neighborhoods
shaded by the number of suicides.

Let's load the San Francisco suicides-by-neighborhood data
that we made earlier. We'll also want to project it to the
standard longitude and latitude projection.

It gives us a blank map because our polygons are projected
to San Francisco's projection while the \texttt{leaflet} map
expects the standard CRS, WGS84 which uses longitude and
latitude. So we need to change our projection to that using
the \texttt{st\_transform()} function from the \texttt{sf}
package.

neighborhood. Let's change the appearance of the graph a bit
before making a popup or shading the neighborhoods The
parameter \texttt{color} in \texttt{addPolygons()} changes
the color of the lines - let's change it to black. The lines
are also very thick, blurring into each other and making the
neighborhoods hard to see. We can change the \texttt{weight}
parameter to alter the size of these lines - smaller values
are thinner lines. Let's try setting this to 1.

That looks better and we can clearly distinguish each

function which makes the geographic shapes, in this case
\texttt{addPolygons()}. Let's add the \emph{nhood} column
value - the name of that neighborhood - and the number of
suicides that occurred in that neighborhood. As before, when
we click on a neighborhood a popup appears with the output
we specified.

For these types of maps we generally want to shade each
polygon to indicate how frequently the event occurred in the
polygon. We'll use the function \texttt{colorNumeric()}
which takes a lot of the work out of the process of coloring
in the map. This function takes two inputs, first a color
palette which we can get from the site
\href{http://colorbrewer2.org/\#type=sequential\&scheme=OrRd\&n=3}{Color
Brewer}. Let's use the fourth bar in the Sequential page,
which is light orange to red. If you look in the section
with each HEX value it says that the palette is ``3-class
OrRd''. The ``3-class'' just means we selected 3 colors, the
``OrRd'' is the part we want. That will tell
\texttt{colorNumeric()} to make the palette using these
colors. The second parameter is the column for our numeric
variable, \emph{number\_suicides}.

We will save the output of
\texttt{colorNumeric("OrRd",\ sf\_neighborhoods\_suicide\$number\_suicides)}
as a new object which we'll call \emph{pal} for convenience
since it is a palette of colors. Then inside of
\texttt{addPolygons()} we'll set the parameter
\texttt{fillColor} to
\texttt{pal(sf\_neighborhoods\_suicide\$number\_suicides)},
running this function on the column. What this really does
is determine which color every neighborhood should be based
on the value in the \emph{number\_suicides} column.

Since the neighborhoods are transparent, it is hard to
distinguish which color is shown. We can make each
neighborhood a solid color by setting the parameter
\texttt{fillOpacity} inside of \texttt{addPolygons()} to 1.

To add a legend to this we use the function
\texttt{addLegend()} which takes three parameters.
\texttt{pal} asks which color palette we are using - we want
it to be the exact same as we use to color the neighborhoods
so we'll use the \emph{pal} object we made. The
\texttt{values} parameter is used for which column our
numeric values are from, in our case the
\emph{number\_suicides} column so we'll input that. Finally
\texttt{opacity} determines how transparent the legend will
be. As each neighborhood is set to not be transparent at
all, we'll also set this to 1 to be consistent.

\hypertarget{scrape-table}{%
\chapter{Scraping tables from PDFs}\label{scrape-table}}

For this chapter you'll need the following file, which is
available for download
\href{https://github.com/jacobkap/r4crimz/tree/master/data}{here}:
usbp\_stats\_fy2017\_sector\_profile.pdf.

Government agencies in particular like to release their data
in long PDFs which often have the data we want in a table on
one of the pages. To use this data we need to scrape it from
the PDF into R. In the majority of cases when you want data
from a PDF it will be in a table. Essentially the data will
be an Excel file inside of a PDF. This format is not
altogether different than what we've done before.

Let's first take a look at the data we will be scraping. The
first step in any PDF scraping should be to look at the PDF
and try to think about the best way to approach this
particular problem. While all PDF scraping follows a general
format, you cannot necessarily reuse your old code as each
situation is likely slightly different. Our data is from the
US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and contains a wealth
of information about apprehensions and contraband seizures
in border sectors.

We will be using the Sector Profile 2017 PDF which has
information in four tables, three of which we'll scrape and
then combine together. The data was downloaded from the US
Customs and Border Protection ``Stats and Summaries'' page
\href{https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/media-resources/stats}{here}.
If you're interested in using more of their data, some of it
has been cleaned and made available
\href{https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/109522/version/V2/view}{here}.

The file we want to use is called
``usbp\_stats\_fy2017\_sector\_profile.pdf'' and has four
tables in the PDF. Let's take a look at them one at a time,
understanding what variables are available, and what units
each row is in. Then we'll start scraping the tables.

The first table is ``Sector Profile - Fiscal Year 2017
(Oct.~1st through Sept.~30th)''. Before we even look down
more at the table, the title is important. It is for fiscal
year 2017, not calendar year 2017 which is more common in
the data we usually use. This is important if we ever want
to merge this data with other data sets. If possible, we
would have to get data that is monthly so we can just use
October 2016 through September 2017 to match up properly.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth,height=0.45\textheight,]{images/pdf_table_1} \end{center}

Now if we look more at the table, we can see that each row
is a section of the US border. There are three main sections
- Coastal, Northern, and Southwest, with subsections of each
also included. The bottom row is the sum of all these
sections and gives us nationwide data. Many government data
sets will be like this form with sections and subsections in
the same table. Watch out when doing mathematical
operations! Just summing any of these columns will give you
triple the true value due to the presence of nationwide,
sectional, and subsectional data.

There are 9 columns in the data other than the border
section identifier. We have total apprehensions,
apprehensions for people who are not Mexican citizens,
marijuana and cocaine seizures (in pounds), the number of
accepted prosecutions (presumably of those apprehended), and
the number of CBP agents assaulted. The last two columns
have the number of people rescued by CBP and the number of
people who died (it is unclear from this data alone if this
is solely people in custody or deaths during crossing the
border). These two columns are also special as they only
have data for the Southwest border.

Table 2 has a similar format with each row being a section
or subsection. The columns now have the number of juveniles
apprehended, subdivided by if they were accompanied by an
adult or not, and the number of adults apprehended. The last
column is total apprehensions which is also in Table 1.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth,height=0.45\textheight,]{images/pdf_table_2} \end{center}

Table 3 follows the same format and the new columns are
number of apprehensions by gender.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth,height=0.45\textheight,]{images/pdf_table_3} \end{center}

Finally, Table 4 is a bit different in its format. The rows
are now variables and the columns are the locations. In this
table it doesn't include subsections, only border sections
and the nationwide total. The data it has available are
partially a repeat of Table 1 but with more drug types and
the addition of the number of drug seizures and some firearm
seizure information. As this table is formatted differently
than the others, we won't scrape it in this lesson - but you
can use the skills you'll learn to do so yourself.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth,height=0.45\textheight,]{images/pdf_table_4} \end{center}

\hypertarget{scraping-the-first-table}{%
\section{Scraping the first
table}\label{scraping-the-first-table}}

We've now seen all three of the tables that we want to
scrape so we can begin the process of actually scraping
them. Note that each table is very similar meaning that we
can reuse some code to scrape as well as to clean the data.
That means that we will want to write some functions to make
our work easier and avoid copy and pasting code.

We will start by using the \texttt{pdf\_text()} function
from the \texttt{pdftools} package to read the PDFs into R.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{install.packages}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"pdftools"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(pdftools)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can assign the output of the \texttt{pdf\_text()}
function to the object \emph{border\_patrol} and we'll use
it for each table. The input to \texttt{pdf\_text()} is the
name of the PDF we want to scrape.

\end{Shaded}

We can take a look at the \texttt{head()} of the result.

If you look closely in this huge amount of text output, you
can see that it is a vector with each table being an element
in the vector. We can see this further by checking the
\texttt{length()} of ``border\_patrol'' which tells us how
many elements are in a vector.

It is four elements long, one for each table.

Looking at just the first element in \emph{border\_patrol}
gives us all the values in the first table plus a few
sentences at the end detailing some features of the table.
At the end of each line (where in the PDF it should end but
doesn't in our data yet) there is a
\texttt{\textbackslash{}n} indicating that there should be a
new line. We want to use \texttt{strsplit()} to split at the
\texttt{\textbackslash{}n}.

The \texttt{strsplit()} function breaks up a string into
pieces based on a value inside of the string. Let's use the
word ``criminology'' as an example. If we want to split it
by the letter ``n'' we'd have two results, ``crimi'' and
``ology'' as these are the pieces of the word after breaking
up ``criminology'' at letter ``n''.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{strsplit}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"criminology"}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{split =} \StringTok{"n"}\NormalTok{)}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [[1]]}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1] "crimi" "ology"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note that it deletes whatever value is used to break up the
string.

Let's assign a new object with the value in the first
element of \emph{border\_patrol}, calling it
\emph{sector\_profile} as that's the name of that table, and
then using \texttt{strsplit()} on it to split it every
\texttt{\textbackslash{}n}. In effect this makes each line
of the table an element in a vector that we'll create rather
than having the entire table be a single long string as it
is now. \texttt{strsplit()} returns a list so we will also
want to keep just the first element of that list using
double square bracket \texttt{{[}{[}{]}{]}} notation.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{sector\_profile }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ border\_patrol[}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{]}

\NormalTok{sector\_profile }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ sector\_profile[[}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{]]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Now we can look at the first six rows of this data.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

{[}4{]} '' Agent Other Than Mexican Marijuana Cocaine

{[}6{]} '' Apprehensions''

Notice that there is a lot of empty white space at the
beginning of the rows. We want to get rid of that to make
our next steps easier. We can use \texttt{trimws()} and put
the entire \emph{sector\_profile} data in the () and it'll
remove any white space that is at the beginning or end of
the string.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

Based on the PDF, we want every row from Miami to Nationwide
Total. But here we have several rows with the title of the
table and the column names, and at the end we have the
sentences with some details that we don't need.

To keep only the rows that we want, we can combine
\texttt{grep()} and subsetting to find the rows from Miami
to Nationwide Total and keep only those rows. We will use
\texttt{grep()} to find which row has the text ``Miami'' and
which has the text ``Nationwide Total'' and keep all rows
between them (including those matched rows as well). Since
each only appears once in the table we don't need to worry
about handling duplicate results.

\begin{Shaded}

\FunctionTok{grep}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"Nationwide Total"}\NormalTok{, sector\_profile)}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1] 34}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We'll use square bracket notation to keep all rows between
those two values (including each value). Since the data is a
vector, not a data.frame, we don't need a comma.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{sector\_profile }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ sector\_profile[}\FunctionTok{grep}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"Miami"}\NormalTok{, sector\_profile)}\SpecialCharTok{:}\FunctionTok{grep}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"Nationwide Total"}\NormalTok{, sector\_profile)]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note that we're getting rid of the rows which had the column
names. It's easier to make the names ourselves than to deal
with that mess. The data now has only the rows we want but
still doesn't have any columns, it's currently just a vector
of strings. We want to make it into a data.frame to be able
to work on it like we usually do.

\begin{Shaded}

{[}6{]} ``Blaine 296 288 237 0 0 9 0 N/A N/A''

When looking at this data it is clear that where the
division between columns is supposed to be is a bunch of
white space in each string. Take the first row for example,
it says ``Miami'' then after lots of white spaces ``111''
than again with ``2,280'' and so on for the rest of the row.
We'll use this pattern of columns differentiated by white
space to make \emph{sector\_profile} into a data.frame.

We will use the function \texttt{str\_split\_fixed()} from
the \texttt{stringr} package. This function is very similar
to \texttt{strsplit()} except you can tell it how many
columns to expect.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(stringr)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The syntax of \texttt{str\_split\_fixed()} is similar to
\texttt{strsplit()} except the new parameter of the number
of splits to expect. The ``\_fixed'' part of
\texttt{str\_split\_fixed()} is that it expects the same
number of splits (which in our case become columns) for
every element in the vector that we input. Looking at the
PDF shows us that there are 10 columns so that's the number
we'll use. Our split will be '' \{2,\}``. That is, a space
that occurs two or more times. Since there are sectors with
spaces in their name, we can't have only one space, we need
at least two. If you look carefully at the rows with
sectors''Coastal Border Sectors Total'' and ``Northern
Border Sectors Total'', the final two columns actually do
not have two spaces between them because of the amount of
asterisks they have. Normally we'd want to fix this using
\texttt{gsub()}, but those values will turn to NA anyway so
we won't bother in this case.

\end{Shaded}

If we check the \texttt{head()} we can see that we have the
proper columns now, but this still isn't a data.frame and
has no column names.

We can make it a data.frame just by putting it in
\texttt{data.frame()}. And we can assign the columns names
using a vector of strings we can make. We'll use the same
column names as in the PDF but in lowercase and replacing
spaces and parentheses with underscores.

scraped it to a data.frame in R. Now we can work on it as we

To really be able to use this data we'll want to clean the
columns to turn the values to numeric type but we can leave
that until later. For now let's write a function that
replicates much of this work for the next tables.

\hypertarget{making-a-function}{%
\section{Making a function}\label{making-a-function}}

As we've done before, we want to take the code we wrote for
the specific case of the first table in this PDF and turn it
into a function for the general case of other tables in the
PDF. Let's copy the code we used above before we convert it
to a function.

\begin{Shaded}

  \StringTok{"assaults"}\NormalTok{,}
  \StringTok{"rescues"}\NormalTok{,}
  \StringTok{"deaths"}
\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Since each table is so similar our function will only need a
few changes in the above code to work for all three tables.
The object \emph{border\_patrol} has all four of the tables
in the data, so we need to say which of these tables we want
- we can call the parameter \texttt{table\_number}. Then
each table has a different number of columns so we need to
change the \texttt{str\_split\_fixed()} function to take a
variable with the number of columns we input, a value we'll
call \texttt{number\_columns}. We rename each column to its
proper name so we need to input a vector - which we'll call
\texttt{column\_names} - with the names for each column.
Finally, we want to have a parameter where we enter in the
data which holds all of the tables, our object
\emph{border\_patrol}, we can call this
\texttt{list\_of\_tables} as it is fairly descriptive.

We do this as it is bad form (and potentially dangerous) to
have a function that relies on an object that isn't
explicitly put in the function. It we change our
\emph{border\_patrol} object (such as by scraping a
different file but calling that object
\emph{border\_patrol}) and the function doesn't have that as
an input, it will work differently than we expect. Since we
called the object we scraped \emph{sector\_profile} for the
first table, let's change that to \emph{data} as not all
tables are called Sector Profile.

Now let's run this function for each of the three tables we
want to scrape, changing the function's parameters to work
for each table. To see what parameter values you need to
input, look at the PDF itself or the screenshots in this
lesson.

\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can use the function \texttt{left\_join()} from the
\texttt{dplyr} package to combine the three tables into a
single object. In the first table there are some asterisks
after the final two row names in the Sector column. For our
match to work properly we need to delete them which we can
do using \texttt{gsub()}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{table\_1}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{sector }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{gsub}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"}\SpecialCharTok{\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}}\StringTok{*"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{""}\NormalTok{, table\_1}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{sector)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Now we can run \texttt{left\_join()}. \texttt{left\_join()}
will automatically join based on shared column names in the
two data sets we are joining. In our case this is ``sector''
and ``total\_apprehensions.'' All we need to input into
\texttt{left\_join()} is the name of the data sets we want
to join together. \texttt{left\_join()} can only combine two
data sets at a time so we'll first join table\_1 and
table\_2 and then join table\_3 with the result of the first
join, which we'll call ``final\_data.''

In one data set we now have information from three separate
tables in a PDF. We have now scraped three different tables
from a PDF and turned them into a single data set, turning
the PDF into actually usable (and useful) data!

\hypertarget{geocoding}{%
\chapter{Geocoding}\label{geocoding}}

For this chapter you'll need the following file, which is
available for download
\href{https://github.com/jacobkap/r4crimz/tree/master/data}{here}:
san\_francisco\_active\_marijuana\_retailers.csv.

Several recent studies have looked at the effect of
marijuana dispensaries on crime around the dispensary. For
these analyses they find the coordinates of each crime in
the city and see if it occurred in a certain distance from
the dispensary. Many crime data sets provide the coordinates
of where each crime occurred, however sometimes the
coordinates are missing - and other data such as marijuana
dispensary locations give only the address - meaning that we
need a way to find the coordinates of these locations.

\hypertarget{geocoding-a-single-address}{%
\section{Geocoding a single
address}\label{geocoding-a-single-address}}

In this chapter we will cover how to geocode addresses.
Geocoding is the process of taking an address (e.g.~123 Main
Street, Somewhere, CA, 12345) and getting the longitude and
latitude coordinates of that address. With these coordinates
we can then do spatial analyses on the data ranging from
simply making a map and showing where each address is to
merging these coordinates with some other spatial data (such
as seeing which police district the address is in) and
seeing how it relates to other variables, such as crime.

To do our geocoding, we're going to use the package
\texttt{tidygeocoder} which greatly simplifies the work of
geocoding addresses in R. For more information about this
package, please see the package's site
\href{https://jessecambon.github.io/tidygeocoder/}{here}. If
you've never used this package before you'll need to install
it using \texttt{install.packages("tidygeocoder")}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{install.packages}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"tidygeocoder"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Now we need to tell R that we want to use this package by
running \texttt{library(tidygeocoder)}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(tidygeocoder)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

To geocode our addresses we'll use the helpfully named
\texttt{geocode()} function inside of \texttt{tidygeocoder}.
For \texttt{geocode()} we input an address and it returns
the coordinates for that address. For our address we'll use
``750 Race St.~Philadelphia, PA 19106'' which is the address
of the Philadelphia Police Department headquarters.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{geocode}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"750 Race St. Philadelphia, PA 19106"}\NormalTok{)}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} Error: Google now requires an API key.}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{}        See ?register\_google for details.}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

As shown above, running
\texttt{geocode("750\ Race\ St.\ Philadelphia,\ PA\ 19106")}
gives us an error that tells us that ``.tbl is not a
dataframe.'' The issue is that \texttt{geocode()} expects a
data.frame (and .tbl is an abbreviation for tibble which is
a kind of data.frame), but we entered only the string with
our one address, not a data.frame. For this function to work
we need to enter two parameters into \texttt{geocode()}: a
data.frame (or something similar such as a tibble) and the
name of the column which has the addresses.\footnote{We can
  look at all of the parameters for this function by running
  the code \texttt{help(geocode)} or \texttt{?geocode()} to
  look at the functions Help page.} Since we need a
data.frame, we'll make one below. I'm calling it
\emph{address\_to\_geocode} and calling the column with the
address ``address'', but you can call both the data.frame
and the column whatever name you want.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{address\_to\_geocode }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{data.frame}\NormalTok{(}
  \AttributeTok{address =}
    \StringTok{"750 Race St. Philadelphia, PA 19106"}
\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Now let's try again. We'll enter our data.frame
\emph{address\_to\_geocode} first and then the name of our
column which is ``address''.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{geocode}\NormalTok{(address\_to\_geocode, address)}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} Error in geocode(address\_to\_geocode, address): is.character(location) is not TRUE}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

It worked, returning the same data.frame but with two
additional columns with the latitude and longitude of that
address.

You might be wondering why we put ``address'' into
\texttt{geocode()} without quotes when usually when we talk
about a column we need to do so in quotes. The simple answer
is that the authors of the \texttt{tidygeocoder} package
spent the time allowing users to input the column name
either with or without quotes. Trying it again and now
having ``address'' in quotes gives us the same result.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{geocode}\NormalTok{(address\_to\_geocode, }\StringTok{"address"}\NormalTok{)}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} Error in geocode(address\_to\_geocode, "address"): is.character(location) is not TRUE}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

There are two additional parameters which are important to
talk about for this function, especially when you encounter
an address that doesn't geocode properly.

First, there are actually multiple sources where you can
enter an address and get the coordinates for that address.
Just think about the big mapping apps or sites, such as
Google Maps and Apple Maps. For these sources you can enter
in the same address and you'll get different results. In
most cases you'll get extremely similar coordinates, usually
off only after a few decimals points, so they are
functionally identical. But occasionally you'll have some
addresses that can be geocoded through some sources but not
others. This is because some sources have a more
comprehensive list of addresses than others.

At the time of this writing the \texttt{tidygeocoder}
package can handle geocoding from 13 different sources. For
10 of these, however, you need to setup an API key and some
also require paying money (usually after a set number of
addresses that it'll geocode for free each day). So here
I'll just cover the three sources of geocoding that don't
require any setup: ``osm'' (Open Street Map or OSM is
similar to Google Maps), ``census'' (the US Census Bureau's
geocoder), and ``arcgis'' (ArcGIS is a clunky mapping
software that nonetheless has an excellent geocoder that R
can use). To select which of these to use (``osm'' is the
default), you add the parameter ``method'' and set that
equal to which one you want to use. As ``osm'' is the
default we actually don't need to set it explicitly, but
we'll do so anyways here as an example of the three
geocoding sources we want to use.

By default this function returns a tibble instead of a
normal data.frame so it only shows one decimal point by
default - though it doesn't actually round the number,
merely shorten what it shows us. We can change the output
back into a data.frame by using the \texttt{data.frame()}
function. If you check each result after converting it to a
data.frame you'll see that each set of coordinates are very
slightly different, though for all purposes are the same
location.

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Given how similar the coordinates are, you really only need
to set the source of the geocoder in cases where one
geocoder fails to find a match for the address.

The second important parameter is \texttt{full\_results}
which is by default set to FALSE. When set to TRUE it gives
more columns in the returning data.frame than just the
longitude and latitude of that address. These columns differ
for each geocoder source so we'll look at all three. I'll
convert all of these results to a data.frame so it prints
out all of the columns, and doesn't abbreviate results which
is how tibbles function. The
\texttt{example\$display\_name\ \textless{}-\ NULL} isn't
necessary but I use it to remove a column that prints out an
extremely long line for the location's full address and that
looks bad in the print version of this book.

For OSM as a source we also get information about the
address such as what type of place it is, a bounding box
which is a geographic area right around this coordinate, the
address for those coordinates in the OSM database, and a
bunch of other variables that don't seem very useful for our
purposes such as the ``importance'' of the address. It's
interesting that OSM classifies this address as a ``house''
as the headquarters of a major police department is quite a
bit bigger than a house, so this is likely an
misclassification of the type of address. The most important
extra variable here is the address, called the
``display\_name''.

Sometimes geocoders will be quite a bit off in their
geocoding because they match the address you inputted
incorrectly to one in their database. For example, if you
input ``123 Main Street'' and the geocoder thinks you mean
``123 Maine Street'' you may be quite a bit off in the
resulting coordinates. When you only get coordinates
returned you won't know that the coordinates are wrong. Even
if you know where an address is supposed to be it's hard to
catch errors like this. If you're geocoding addresses in a
single city and one point is in a different city (or
completely different part of the world), then it's pretty
clear that there's an error. But if the coordinates are
simply in a wrong part of the city, but near other
coordinates, then it's very hard to notice a problem. So
having an address to check against the one you inputted is a
very useful way of validate the geocoding.

The Census results are similar to the OSM results and also
have the matched address to compare your inputted address
to. Most of the columns are just the address broken into
different pieces (street, city, state, etc.) so are mostly
repeating the address again in multiple columns.

For the ArcGIS results we have the matched address again,
and then an important variable called ``score'' which is
basically a measure of how confident ArcGIS is that it
matched the right address. Higher values are more confident,
but in my experience anything under 90-95 confidence is an
incorrect address. These results also repeat the longitude
and latitude columns as ``location.x'' and ``location.y''
columns, and I'm not sure why they do so.

So now that we can use the \texttt{geocoder()} function
well, we can geocode every location in our marijuana
dispensary data.

Let's read in the marijuana dispensary data which is called
``san\_francisco\_active\_marijuana\_retailers.csv'' and
call the object \emph{marijuana}. Note the ``data/'' part in
front of the name of the .csv file. This is to tell R that
the file we want is in the ``data'' folder of our working
directory. Doing this is essentially a shortcut to changing
the working directory directly. For this book I keep all of
the data files in a folder called ``data'' in my working
directory. Unless you also have a folder called ``data'' in
your working directory which has this file, please delete
``data/'' from the following code.

The column with the address is called \emph{Premise
Address}. Since the address county is always '' County: SAN
FRANCISCO'' we can just \texttt{gsub()} out that entire
string.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{marijuana}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{Premise.Address }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{gsub}\NormalTok{(}
  \StringTok{" County: SAN FRANCISCO"}\NormalTok{,}
  \StringTok{""}\NormalTok{, marijuana}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{Premise.Address}
\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Now let's make sure we did it right.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{(marijuana}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{Premise.Address)}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [1] "2165 IRVING ST san francisco, CA 94122" }
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [2] "122 10TH ST SAN FRANCISCO, CA 941032605"}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [3] "843 Howard ST SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94103"  }
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [4] "70 SECOND ST SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94105"   }
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [5] "527 Howard ST San Francisco, CA 94105"  }
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} [6] "2414 Lombard ST San Francisco, CA 94123"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

To do the geocoding we'll just tell \texttt{geocode()} our
data.frame name and the name of the column with the
addresses. We'll assign the results back into the
\texttt{marijuana} object. As noted earlier, we don't need
to put the name of our column in quotes, but I like to do so
because it is consistent with some other functions that
require it. Running this code may take up to a minute
because it's geocoding 33 different addresses.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{marijuana }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{geocode}\NormalTok{(marijuana, }\StringTok{"Premise.Address"}\NormalTok{)}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} Error in geocode(marijuana, "Premise.Address"): is.character(location) is not TRUE}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Now it appears that we have longitude and latitude for every
dispensary. We should check that they all look sensible.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{summary}\NormalTok{(marijuana}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{long)}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} Length  Class   Mode }
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{}      0   NULL   NULL}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{summary}\NormalTok{(marijuana}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{lat)}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} Length  Class   Mode }
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{}      0   NULL   NULL}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The minimum and maximum are very similar to each other for
both longitude and latitude so that's a sign that it
geocoded correctly. The 10 NA values mean that it didn't
find a match for 10 of the addresses. Let's try again and
now set \texttt{method} to ``arcgis'' which generally has a
very high match rate. Before we do this let's just remove
the entire latitude and longitude columns from our data. How
the \texttt{geocode()} function works is that if we keep the
``long'' and ``lat'' columns that are currently in the data
from when we just geocoded, when we run it again it'll make
new columns that have nearly identical names. We usually
want as few columns in our data as possible so there's no
point having the ``lat'' column from the last geocode run
with the 10 NAs and another ``lat'' (though slightly
different, automatically chosen name) column from this time
we run \texttt{geocode().}

We could also just geocode the 10 addresses that failed on
the first run, but given that we'll only be geocoding a
small number of addresses it won't take much extra time to
have ArcGIS run it all. Running this function on just the NA
rows requires a bit more work than just rerunning them all.
In general, when the choice is between you spending time
writing code and letting the computer do more work, let the
computer do the work. And in general I'd recommend starting
with ArcGIS as it is more reliable for geocoding. We'll
remove the current coordinate columns by setting them each
to NULL.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{marijuana}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{long }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \ConstantTok{NULL}
\NormalTok{marijuana}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{lat }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \ConstantTok{NULL}
\NormalTok{marijuana }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{geocode}\NormalTok{(marijuana, }\StringTok{"Premise.Address"}\NormalTok{,}
  \AttributeTok{method =} \StringTok{"arcgis"}
\NormalTok{)}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} Error in geocode(marijuana, "Premise.Address", method = "arcgis"): is.character(location) is not TRUE}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

And let's do the \texttt{summary()} check again.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{summary}\NormalTok{(marijuana}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{long)}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} Length  Class   Mode }
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{}      0   NULL   NULL}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{summary}\NormalTok{(marijuana}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{lat)}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} Length  Class   Mode }
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{}      0   NULL   NULL}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

No more NAs which means that we successfully geocoded our
addresses. Another check is to make a simple scatterplot of
the data. Since all of the data is from San Francisco, they
should be relatively close to each other. If there are dots
far from the rest, that is probably a geocoding issue.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{plot}\NormalTok{(marijuana}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{long, marijuana}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{lat)}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} Warning in min(x): no non{-}missing arguments to min;}

\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} Error in plot.window(...): need finite \textquotesingle{}xlim\textquotesingle{} values}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Most points are within a very narrow range so it appears
that our geocoding worked properly.
